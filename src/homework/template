Info:

This assignment is an odd-ball, because we haven't had much time to work in class yet, and it is the only one where I specifically want you to do these questions.  The deadline is loose, whenever you get it done is fine.  Don't pay any attention to the scores that it tells you -- what I care about is that you are doing work outside of class to continue your development as a physicist.  Use your results as feedback to help you plan what to work on next, and, of course, come see during and after class to ask questions about it.
