PairSolving
 * `Pair programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming>`_ a software development technique in which two programmers work together. One is the "driver", sitting at the keyboard and typing code, focusing on the tactical aspects of completing the task.  The other is the "observer", who watches each line typed, reviewing each line to make sure it achieves the desired goal, and focusing on strategic aspects of the task, thinking about how to improve the code as it is written, asking questions and making suggestions.
 * For in class problem solving, this will take the form of a "Driver" who has possession of the whiteboard and pen, who is responsible for writing down parts of a problem solution, and the "Observer" who is not allowed to touch the whiteboard but who talks, suggesting ideas, asking questions, and checking to make sure that everything written down is correct/makes sense and contributes to solving the problem.  We will swap roles frequently, every few minutes while working on tough problems so both members of a pair will take on each role.  In groups where we are forced to have three members, there will be two observers and one Driver, and we will rotate through the jobs frequently
