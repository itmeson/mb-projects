:category: topics
:tags: vocabulary

Some topics and vocabulary as we're getting started:

 * variance, accuracy, precision, bias
 * false positive, false negative, true positive, true negative
 * no free lunch theorem in AI
 * symbolist, connectionist, evolutionary, Bayesian, analogizer
 * inverse deduction, backpropagation, genetic programming, Bayes' Theorem, support vector machine
 * problem of induction
 * overfitting, noise, too many hypotheses/not enough data 
 * underfitting
 * Occam's razor
 * Deduction
 * Decision trees
 * tf-idf: term frequency - inverse document frequency = log # docs / (1 + # docs term occurs in)
 * Supervised vs. unsupervised
 * Voronoi tesselation
 * Co-occurrence matrices
 * Featured Matrix factorization
 * precision vs. recall
 * recall: how many of the items I actually liked were actually recommended to me (lots of TruePositives, few FalseNegatives)
 * precision: how many of the items that were recommended to me were ones I actually liked (lots of TruePositives, few FalsePositives)
 * Accuracy is not good enough for a recommender system because the classes are imbalanced (user doesn't like most of the things)
 * Precision-recall curve
 * AUC (area under the curve), or max precision for given recall (or max recall for given precision)
 *
