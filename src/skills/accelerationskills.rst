Acceleration
------------

  `P.S.A.1`_:  I know the difference between acceleration and velocity

  `P.S.A.2`_:  I can calculate the acceleration of an object with direction and proper units

  `P.S.A.3`_:  I can interpret/draw motion diagrams for objects moving with changing velocity

  `P.S.A.4`_:  I can interpret/draw the position vs. time graph for an object moving with changing velocity

  `P.S.A.5`_:  I can interpret/draw the velocity vs. time graph for an object moving with changing velocity

  `P.S.A.6`_:  I can use motion concepts to solve problems involving objects with changing velocity

  `P.S.A.7`_:  I can use the position update formula to solve problems involving objects with changing velocity

  `P.S.A.8`_:  I can articulate the difference between average velocity(speed) and instantaneous velocity(speed)

  `P.S.A.9`_:  I can explain the relationship between the position update formula and graphical representations of an object's motion

  `P.S.A.10`_:  I can explain the relationship between the position update formula and functional representations of an object's motion
