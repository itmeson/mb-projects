Roger Peng did this really interesting lecture on the occasion of his promotion to full professor at Johns Hopkins, talking about the future of data analysis through two lenses: past impressions of what the future of data analysis might be, and a discussion of the aesthetics of data analysis.  It's hard to say what makes a good data analysis or what makes a bad one, just as, in some ways, it is hard to say what makes good music or bad music.  But there is a theory around music and musical aesthetics that allows one to describe music and to describe what is good and not good about it.

We don't have rules yet, so everything seems great (or almost everything!).  When you do exploratory data analysis, every possibility seems great.

How do we go about finding the theory? Science.  Just as with pedagogy research and visualization research, there are experiments that can be done.

Study *music*, not *instruments*.
