## Stage -1 - Axes

Optimizing on multiple axes at a time.

*   Why.  (Philosophical purpose of work)
*   What. (Content and skills covered and assessed)
*   How.  (Time usage, projects done, assignments, etc., etc.)


## Stage 0 - Assumptions

*   Audience
    *	Seniors who have not yet completed calculus
    *   Who have chosen this class for a variety of reasons
    *   Who have had an open-ended conceptual physical science course as 9th graders
    *   Who are all going to college  

*   Constraints
    *   Time
        *   Three 45 minute, one 95 minute session per week
        *   Two 11 week trimesters, one 4 week trimester
        *   Many broken weeks due to field trips, holidays, etc.
        *   Many absences due to extracurriculars, college meetings, etc.
        *   About 75% of seat time of "typical" 12th grade class
    *   Math experience
        *   Range from Algebra 3 to Precalculus to Calculus I
        *   All can compute slope, can graph, can solve linear and some quadratic equations
        *   Many are not clear on relationship between slope and rate of change
        *   All exposed to trig functions, few are totally comfortable with them
    *   Programming environment
        * wide range of experience, from None to Guru
        * [vpython](http://vpython.org "vpython") in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org "Jupyter notebook") has debugging, exposes all of python and Pandas, docker/binder for pushing, github integration, ecosystem
    *   WORK
        * 90% of work will need to be done in class
        * must have make-up plan for every class session (as in, How will student make up for having missed this?)
        * homework through MasteringPhysics.  Approximately 3 hours per week of reading, reading quizzes, and homework problems, done alone
	* this homework will be to develop critical reading skills and serve as a checkpoint.  Will need to train them to read carefully

*   Materials, organized by
    *   TIME
        *  One lesson per week documenting the plan and what actually happened
        *  Links to homework
        *  Links to quizzes/assessments
        *  Links to reference materials, activities, videos, etc.
    *   TOPIC

## Stage 0.5 - Some project ideas

This is out of order for UBD, but I have to write them down

*   AAPT Photo contest
*   Framing device (?) of exploring the universe - start with special relativity
*   Coding challenges
*   Better know a scientist
*   Construct an exemplar problem for each unit.  Other students read all, solve one or two, and vote on best (for pedagogy and for interest) -- I use results to choose problems for the next year
*   Some students work as Learning Assistants in Science9 (or 6,7,8)
*   Students prepare and deliver outreach materials for middle school / community
*   Mini-capstone for each unit, can choose product (presentation, simulation, photo-essay, graphs)
