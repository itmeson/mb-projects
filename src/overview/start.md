Summary: What is the point of this, as I understand it right now?



The world is changing, and that change is accelerating.  It is not clear where we are going or how far we will get, nor is it clear what must be done to prepare students of today (and  teachers of today) for that future.  My task is to contribute to figuring that out while doing the best we can with the students we have right now.

 * Computational thinking is an emerging component of good citizenship
 * Computational skills are emerging as requirements for good employment
 * Computation is an interesting and rewarding form of human expression


I will be teaching two new, single-trimester electives next year, **Computational Thinking: Dealing with data** and **Computational Thinking: AI, Machine Learning, and the Future**, in addition to dramatically expanding the computational component of senior physics.  These courses will partly serve as dry runs for the new graduation requirement course that will first be offered in 2019-2020 and partly as models for future higher level courses that we will be offering as demand for them grows.  I will also be contributing to data analysis for the science department to help us understand how classroom climate is contributing to learning outcomes and equity/inclusion for all our students.  

In order to facilitate creating those courses and other materials, I'm going to be starting out by doing a deep dive / crash course in a bunch of things:

 * Data science in general (datacamp course)
 * Machine learning in general (coursera specialization, books)
 * Ethics, history (books, Audrey Watters, conferences?)
 * Computational pedagogy (books, courses, workshops?)
 * Tooling for students (??)


I'm going to be reporting to the Deans of Faculty (for STEM and Innovations) as well as to my Head of School, and meeting with a number of school stakeholders to understand what they have to offer and what concerns they have, both about the implementation of these courses and the longer term questions about what these technologies mean for our school and our students.
