Summary: What is the computational thinking course?


# Computational Thinking: Machine Learning, AI, and the Future


Machine learning, automation, and artificial intelligence are technologies that already have dramatic effects on our daily lives, and will continue to impact them in challenging ways -- from recommending our music, targeting our advertising, and managing our money to driving our cars. In many ways these technologies will change the nature of work in many fields.  This trimester course will explore the technologies behind the hype to develop an understanding of how they work, where they are headed, the ethical issues raised by them, and how to navigate a changing world.  Students will complete demonstration programming projects, read primary literature, and engage in discussion.  Prior programming experience is not required.

 * Computational thinking is an emerging component of good citizenship
 * Computational skills are emerging as requirements for good employment
 * Computation is an interesting and rewarding form of human expression

General goals of the course and of the Computational Thinking requirement:

 * Know the basics of one programming language 
 * Logically organize and analyze data
 * Decompose large problems into discrete functional steps
 * Look at basic code and discern its purpose

 * Represent data through abstractions such as models  and simulations
 * Automate solutions through algorithmic thinking
 * Generalize and transfer problem solving to a wide variety of situations

 * Develop the technical insight to ask good questions
 * Understanding artificial intelligence in the 21st century
 * How can computers help/hinder human decision making?

Specific goals:

 * Understand the distinction between machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics/data science
 * Understand the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning
 * Understand the distinctions between regression, classification, ....




We want graduates of our programs to embrace the opportunities to combine their imagination and modern computation to better understand the physical, social, intellectual and cultural worlds they inhabit and, as appropriate, to develop ways to improve them. Students will embrace the practice of overcoming barriers, testing ideas, and adjusting strategies.  We, as a community, believe that programs centered around purposeful problem solving strategies that leverage modern computing is becoming a fundamental skill in the 21st century throughout a variety of industries.  SAAS cultivates students to be adept in many areas that we believe to make them ready for the world ahead of them.  Fluency in computational problem solving will become a fundamental capability of successful students.
