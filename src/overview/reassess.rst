1. Use the calendar below to select a day and time when we are both available.

2. Fill out the requested info on when you want to meet and why

3. If you are just retaking a skill assessment, take a 5 minute slot.  If you need to work through something with me, then estimate how long it will take and select an appropriate time slot.

4. Make sure to tell me what you want to do *specifically* so I can prepare for the meeting.  If you are doing a retake, I will write a new version of the assessment just for you, and I need time to prepare it.
